# generate the ast tree:
- understand the structure from top to down 
- use test cases
- prepare interface for code-gen

    decls = smap_new();  //hold all the declarations

    strings = smap_new(); .. //hold a reference to each string literal
    keyword_str_to_enum = smap_new(); //for faster lookup of keywords->enum
